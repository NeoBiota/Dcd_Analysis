# input dcd file
# pickle contains dictionary of lipidname(key) and a bondlist
# that contains indices of atoms involved in the calculation
# according to the Cn-1 - Cn+1 vectors
# frames to be read (-1 is last frame)
# frames: can be an tuple - yaml syntax: !!python/tuple [start, end, step]
# or a list of frame numbers
# avg_slice: averaging over every x frames
# output: list of string (['all'], ['avg'], ['all', 'avg'])
# avg means averaged over residue!!
# outname: prefix for saving output data
