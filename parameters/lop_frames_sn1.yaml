######################### parameter file for lipid_op_fram ################################

# Inputfiles pdb and matching dcd
# lipids:dictonary that contains name of lipid(key) and a tuple
# tuple contains lipid selection text (maybe resname or segid) and bondlist
# bondlist is a list of strings like ["C14-C16", "C15-C17", ...]
# according to the Cn-1 - Cn+1 vectors

# frames to be read (-1 is last frame)
# frames: can be an tuple - yaml syntax: !!python/tuple [start, end, step]
# or a list of frame numbers
# avg_slice: averaging over every x frames, 1 means averaging over all together
# output: list of string (['all'], ['avg'], ['all', 'avg'])
# avg means averaged over residue!!
# outname: prefix for saving output data
